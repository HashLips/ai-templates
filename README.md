# AI Templates

This repository is an experimental, collection of reusable prompt requirement templates. The goal is to give developers, creators, and teams a solid baseline for structuring their prompts so that AI systems can produce clearer, more consistent outputs.

## Using the templates

You can use these templates in a few simple ways:

1. **Copy a template** into your own prompt document.
2. **Fill in the sections** with your specific details.
3. **Iterate**:
   - Adjust sections that don’t fit your workflow.
   - Add/removes sections as needed.
4. **Test with your AI tool of choice** (ChatGPT, Claude, local LLM, etc.) and refine.

Nothing in this repo is tied to a specific model or provider. The templates are meant to be **provider-agnostic**.
